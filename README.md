# Sportify

Sportify is a **dummy website** built to demonstrate a responsive design and advanced front-end techniques. The site has no real functionality but serves as a practice project to apply HTML, CSS, and advanced Sass skills.

This project is part of a broader learning roadmap, showcasing the application of various web development tools and techniques.

## Project Overview

Sportify is designed to simulate a platform where users can discover and track available sports and events in their local area. Though it's a static site with no backend functionality, it provides a strong foundation for understanding responsive design and modern CSS practices.

### Key Features

- **Dummy Functionality:** The website is static and includes no real functionality.
- **Advanced Sass:** Utilizes advanced Sass features such as variables, mixins, and the 7-1 architecture to organize styles.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **SVG Icons:** Custom SVG icons created using Adobe Illustrator and sourced from Flaticon to enhance visual design.
- **PWA Installable:** The website is a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing users to install it on their devices for an app-like experience.
- **UI Design in Figma:** The UI was designed using Figma, inspired by Pinterest and Dribbble. You can view the design [here](https://www.figma.com/design/pOLsZqtfokZ0PmLqIGFFK8/Sportify?t=9sMM6aZWvSXga6q4-0).

## Tools and Technologies

- **HTML5 & CSS3:** The fundamental technologies used to structure and style the site.
- **Advanced Sass:** Sass is used for modularizing and organizing the CSS using the 7-1 architecture.
- **Flaticon & Adobe Illustrator:** SVG icons are created using Adobe Illustrator and sourced from Flaticon.
- **Figma:** The UI design was crafted in Figma, incorporating design inspiration from platforms like Pinterest and Dribbble.
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox:** Modern layout techniques used to create a responsive and flexible design.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** The site is PWA-enabled, allowing it to be installed on devices for offline access and a more seamless user experience.

## Roadmap Context

This project is part of a learning roadmap designed to build expertise in full-stack development. Sportify demonstrates the application of HTML, CSS, advanced Sass, and other tools, forming a foundational step toward more complex web development projects.

## Additional Information

- **NPM Scripts:** Included for compiling Sass and managing SVG sprites.
- **No Backend:** This site does not include any backend or real-time data processingâ€”it's purely a front-end practice project.
- **PWA:** The website is designed to be installable on devices, offering offline functionality and an app-like experience.
